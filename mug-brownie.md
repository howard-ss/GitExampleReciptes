I love this recipe, because it's so simple to make.

Often times, I will skip the microwave stage, and just eat the brownie mix. There no egg in it, so it's not even a salmonella risk!

I stumbled upon the mug-brownie recipe while scrolling through social media late at night. They couldn't resist trying it and was blown away by the gooey, chocolatey goodness.
